## About Me

👨‍💻 I am a Full Stack Web Developer recently graduated from the SoyHenry bootcamp. Preferably oriented to the Front-End. Which is something that fascinates me because I can see what I am designing and developing at the moment. I feel comfortable working in the Back End too, so my idea is to continue growing in that area as well..

💬 I consider myself a very committed person, with initiative and very curious. I like to work in a team, I believe a lot in collaborative learning. I like to solve problems of all kinds.

🌱 I’m currently learning all about React Native with Typescript.

🏐 In my free time I like to train. I've been playing volleyball since I finished primary school.  And I compete with my friends in a couple of amateur level leagues.
