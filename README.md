## About Me

👨‍💻 I am a Full Stack Web Developer. Preferably oriented to the Front-End. Which is something that fascinates me because I can see what I am designing and developing at the moment.

💬 I consider myself a very committed person, with initiative and very curious. I like to work in a team, I believe a lot in collaborative learning. I like to solve problems of all kinds.

🌱 I’m currently learning all about React Native with Typescript 
 
😄 Pronouns: he | him
